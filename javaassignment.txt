What is Applet?

An applet is a Java program that can be embedded into a web page. It runs inside the web browser and works at client side. An applet is embedded in
 an HTML page using the APPLET or OBJECT tag and hosted on a web server.
Applets are used to make the web site more dynamic and entertaining.

Write a program to describe simple applet, 

import java.applet.*;
import java.awt.*;

public class HelloWorldApplet extends Applet {
   public void paint (Graphics g) {
      g.drawString ("Hello World", 25, 50);
   }
}
